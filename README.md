# 📊 Bank Loan Data Analysis


***📌 Project Overview***

This project involves analyzing a dataset containing information about bank loans. Using SQL queries and an interactive dashboard, I derived key insights into loan distributions, customer demographics, and risk assessment factors. The goal was to explore patterns in loan approvals, defaults, and other financial metrics to assist in better decision-making for financial institutions.



***🚀 Features***

Data Extraction & Processing: Cleaned and structured raw loan data for analysis.

SQL Analysis: Executed SQL queries to extract insights from the dataset.

Interactive Dashboard: Built a dynamic dashboard to visualize key trends and patterns.

Key Metrics: Loan approval rate, default percentage, customer segmentation, interest rate distribution, etc.

Actionable Insights: Identified factors influencing loan approvals and potential risks.



***🛠️ Technologies Used***

SQL (PostgreSQL) - For querying and analyzing loan data.

Power BI - For creating an interactive dashboard.

3. High Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratios Are Linked to Higher Default Rates
4. Longer-Term Loans Are More Popular But Riskier
5. Interest Rates Are Correlated with Loan Status
6. Employment Length and Loan Repayment Ability
7. Home Ownership Affects Default Rates
